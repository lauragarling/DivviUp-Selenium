# DivviUp-Selenium

How to get this working:
1. Go to https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
2. Download Java Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
3. Open Browsers dropdown, click on the Documentation link under Chrome 
4. Download latest stable release
5. Make Eclipse project?
6. Import libraries that you just downloaded 
7. Your chromedriver executable path will probably have to be changed (unless you are lauragarling), if Windows machine, I believe you will also have to change it to chromedriver.exe
8. Run as Java Application
